                             Project 1: Analysis of House Prices
Objective:
Predict the sale prices of houses based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.
The dataset contains both categorical and continuous features.
Techniques Used:
Linear Regression: To predict the continuous variable (house price).
Logistic Regression: If applicable, for any binary classification tasks (e.g., predicting if a house will be above or below a certain price threshold).
Random Forest: Used for model comparison and potentially improving performance over linear regression.

Key Findings:
Model Performance: Provide evaluation metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error, or RMSE.
Mention any interesting patterns or relationships found between features (e.g., location, size of the house) and the target variable.




                           Project 2: Employee Attrition Rate Prediction
Objective:
Predict employee attrition (whether an employee will leave the company) based on factors like age, department, salary, and years at the company.
This is a binary classification problem (attrition or no attrition).
Techniques Used:
Logistic Regression: Applied to predict the likelihood of employee attrition.
Random Forest: Used for better accuracy and to identify important features affecting attrition.
Feature Engineering: Mention any feature transformations (e.g., encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features).

Key Findings:
Model Performance: Report metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC.
Key Features: Highlight the most influential features that impact employee attrition (e.g., job satisfaction, salary, or years at the company).




                                 Project 3: Customer Segmentation
Objective:
Segment customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior, demographic information, or any other relevant features to help with targeted marketing.
Techniques Used:
Clustering: Used K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering to group customers.
Dimensionality Reduction: If applicable, mention the use of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the feature space.

Key Findings:
Segmentation Insights: Describe the characteristics of each customer segment (e.g., high spenders, loyal customers, price-sensitive groups).
Visualization: Include any visualizations (scatter plots, cluster centroids, or bar charts) to showcase the clusters.
